        <h1>Scroll Jacking with CSS</h1>
        <p>Right now you are reading content inside of a fixed-position child of a relatively-positioned transparent area.</p>
        <p>You are hovering over the transparent area (the white tint background) which is displaying this content. This fixed child content has a colored background image with a blend mode which appears to modify the original background image you saw before hover.</p>
        <p>If you keep scrolling down you will see a line. If you hover beneath that line you will be hovering over the next section and it will make this content disappear.</p>

        <h1>Changing Hover Areas</h1>
        <p>You are now reading the second section's fixed content with a green background. This is because you are hovering over the second section (the white tint background).</p>
        <p>If you didn't move your mouse and scrolled to get here, you may have noticed that the hover event doesn't fire until scrolling has completely stopped. This is default browser behavior.</p>
        <p>This means you can quickly scroll to the bottom of the page and it will skip the sections along the way.</p>

        <h1>Why This is Awesome</h1>
        <p>As you can see, the result is pretty amazing for not using any Javascript. This goes to show you that CSS can do some pretty crazy things.</p>

        <h1>Why This Sucks</h1>
        <p>First off, you cant select this text because the "hover" section areas are sitting on top of it. This is because we need to hover event to make this work.</p>
        <p>Secondly, this pen is useless if you aren't hovering over it, so you cant use this on a tablet or phone. Relying on hover is a terrible idea.</p>
